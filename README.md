<h1 align="center"><em>Learning TypeScript</em> Projects</h1>

<p align="center">Hands-on real world projects that helped me exercise my knowledge of TypeScript.</p>

On a mission to master TypeScript in order to contribute to some awesome web-based open-source projects! All projects were completed from _Learning TypeScript_ by Josh Goldberg!

### Types of Projects

Each project follows a chapter in the Learning TypeScript book and aligns to one of the following three categories:

- 🥗 Appetizers: bite-sized directed warmups: set of independent mini-projects
- 🍲 Entrees: larger, more hands-off challenge: a single self-contained project
- 🍰 Desserts: the same structure as entrees, with a fun thematic twist
